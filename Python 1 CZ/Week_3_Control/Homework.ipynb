    "Create a simple shopping list application that allows users to add and remove items from a shopping list. The program should have the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Display the current shopping list to the user, including the name and quantity of each item.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Allow the user to add items to the shopping list by entering the name and quantity of each item.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Allow the user to remove items from the shopping list by entering the name of the item.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Allow the user to update the quantity of items in the shopping list.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Allow the user to view the total cost of all items in the shopping list, based on a fixed price for each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this project, you can use a dictionary to store the shopping list items, where the keys are the names of the items and the values are the quantities of each item. You can use a loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input and carry out the desired operations, such as adding or removing items from the shopping list."
