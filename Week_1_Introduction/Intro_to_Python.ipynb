Here are some key features and operations you should be familiar with when working with strings in Python:\n","\n"," - **Indexing**: You can access individual characters of a string using indexing. The first character of the string has index $0$, the second character has index `1` and so on. You can also use negative indexing to access characters from the end of the string, with the last character having index `-1`, the second-last character having index `-2`, and so on.\n","\n"," - **Slicing**: You can extract a portion of a string using slicing. Slicing is done using square brackets `[]` with the start index (inclusive), end index (exclusive), and step size (optional) separated by colons `:`. For example, `my_ string[2:5]` would extract the characters from index `2` to index `4` of the string my_string.\n","\n"," - **Concatenation**: You can concatenate two or more strings using the + operator. For example, `\"Hello\" + \" \" + \"world\"` would produce the string `\"Hello world\"`.\n","\n"," - **Repetition**: You can repeat a string a certain number of times using the `*` operator. For example, `\"Hello\" * 3` would produce the string `\"HelloHelloHello\"`.\n","\n"," - **Length**: You can find the length of a string (i.e., the number of characters in the string) using the `len()` function. For example, `len(\"Hello\")` would return the value `5`.\n","\n"," - **Formatting**: You can format a string using placeholders and the `format()` method. Placeholders are denoted by curly braces `{}` and can be replaced with values using the `format()` method. For example, `\"The value of x is {} and the value of y is {}\".format(x, y)` would produce a string with the values of x and y inserted into the placeholders."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["H\n","d\n","lo w\n","Hello\n","world\n","Hello Jan!\n","JanJanJan\n","11\n","The value of x is 5 and the value of y is 10\n"]}],"source":["# Indexing and slicing\n","my_string = \"Hello world\"\n","print(my_string[0])       # Output: 'H'\n","print(my_string[-1])      # Output: 'd'\n","print(my_string[3:7])     # Output: 'lo w'\n","print(my_string[:5])      # Output: 'Hello'\n","print(my_string[6:])      # Output: 'world'\n","\n","# Concatenation and repetition\n","greeting = \"Hello\"\n","name = \"Jan\"\n","message = greeting + \" \" + name + \"!\"\n","print(message)            # Output: 'Hello Jan!'\n","print(name * 3)           # Output: 'JanJanJan'\n","\n","# Length\n","print(len(my_string))     # Output: 11\n","\n","# Formatting\n","x = 5\n","y = 10\n","formatted_string = \"The value of x is {} and the value of y is {}\".format(x, y)\n","print(formatted_string)   # Output: 'The value of x is 5 and the value of y is 10'"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Excercise\n","\n","Write a Python program that asks the user to enter their name and age, and then displays a message that says `\"Hello [name], you are [age] years old!\"`.
